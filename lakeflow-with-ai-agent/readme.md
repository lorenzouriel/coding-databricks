#  LakeFlow with AI Agent
A modern **data lakehouse orchestration project** that integrates **Databricks** and **AI-assisted automation** to manage and monitor data pipelines efficiently.

**LakeFlow** demonstrates an end-to-end **data pipeline architecture** following the **Medallion (Bronze–Silver–Gold)** model.  

It leverages **declarative pipelines**, **AI-driven insights**, and **cloud-native orchestration** to streamline data engineering workflows.

## Repository Structure
| Path | Description |
|------|--------------|
| [`lakeflow/`](lakeflow/) | Core declarative pipeline definitions (Bronze → Silver → Gold) |
| [`lakeflow-simplified/`](lakeflow-simplified/) | Simplified example of pipeline orchestration |
| [`data/`](data/) | Sample datasets used for demonstration |
| [`docs/`](docs/) | Project documentation and visual assets |
| [`gen/`](gen/) | Generated artifacts and model outputs |

## Getting Started
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lakeflow-with-ai-agent.git
cd lakeflow-with-ai-agent
```
### 2. Launch the Pipeline
Run your Databricks workflows depending.
